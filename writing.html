  <summary><h3> sketch "Groping for the edge"</h3></summary>

  <p>Water is dripping from the ceiling. Slick liquid surface is listening to the echo of drops plunging to death and post-mortem tottering in floor’s breath. To the left, to the right – the blackness of mind. Those who inhabit the room are dissolved in the gloom. Open both your hands and move them forward into the unknown. Nothing can be seen anymore; nothing can be read through with one glance. A gaze that usually falls on neighboring objects has left the eyes and now in zero gravity, falling endlessly towards the abyss.</p>
  <p>Every fluctuation is a sound. Ripples on the liquid floor enter bare feet and the whole material body catches the rhythm of the wave. Cold skin testified that one step forward changes currents of the floor. When the head is turned, the picture does not change, but remains a mere blackness. And head spins, eyes follow the non-existing edge of the view, neck stretches tightly, holding head and body together. Like a broken record, all keeps repeated. Water is dripping from the ceiling. To the left, to the right – the blackness of mind.</p>
<p>Sunlight! Hands, braiding from green mellow grass a tiny wreath on a knee. Elusive spikes slip away, the beginning falls apart, one blade bursts, and a whole bouquet of stems falls on the ground. Blink. Head is turned to the right watching the palm that touches thickets of high grass. Spikes disturb a face, a body is moving forward, running. Palm picks a dozen of stems, gives them to another palm. Blink. Hands, braiding from green mellow grass a tiny wreath on a knee. Fingers bind the oval with bright woolly red thread. Missing the tail in the loop, missing the head, thread slips away; hurried breathing, sun retreats, carrying away chunks of light and color. Water is dripping from above. In your cold hands red woolly thread lies in absolute darkness.</p>
<p>Two palms feel but do not see each other. The deprived eye would not own even a shadow. It cannot comprehend darkness, and you see a white web pulsating, green spots, scarlet ovals fading. Forget height, width, length: shoulders are a universe apart, and tips of toes are farther. To have dimensions over control – within reach of arms – the body shrinks, drops to knees. Shin feels cold fluctuating water. Palms hit the floor and it bursts with spray. Crawling on all fours, the body feels powerless in the darkness. Digging in water like in elusive sand you come across a shape. Hands extract it from the viscous floor. The figure is heavy, somewhere edgy, somewhere smoothly curved, detailed to oblivion, limbs randomly spread out. Thick in the middle, it has elongated parts and a spike. Is finger bleeding? You put it against the cheek, but cannot tell: blood or water. Tasting salty: is it the sea outside or rivers within? Thoughts rush in the absence of anything else in the world. Except there is an object in foreign arms: so heavy and cold.</p>
<p>Something blew a fuse in the whole house, and the room went dark. Streetlamp right outside the window is shining light onto one’s hands. The body stands up and performs steps on the parquet floor towards shelves. Hands take a candleholder. Surface of cast iron sends a northern breath of malachite mountain’s forests of its homeland to blow over fingers. A sweet-smelling wax candle is pricked on the spike. The candleholder is not larger than a palm, crafted in the shape of a puss in boots with edgy heels and a hat, shifted to the side.</p>
<p>Water is dripping from the ceiling. The red thread is gone. Fingers are holding a heavy figure of puss in boots, who in turn holds a wax candle in stretched paw. The surface is hard, and the insides are filled with the same heavy metal. Wax can be molded by heated fingers, surrendering to their touch, but the brain is tired from experiencing stone indifference of the cast iron. Sadness and frustration from the solidity of candleholder fills the emptiness. Like a broken record, the mind draws itself a clay world in which iron renounces its steadfastness and can be kneaded. Hands put the object on the knees; the sound of striking a match pleases empty ears. Light pours itself into the eyes as water into a glass. The eyes are full to the brink and light flows out of the skull, dripping down the skin, entering the liquid floor. Darkness is gone, and you see shoulders, hands, bony fingers holding a cat in a hat. Red thread floats on fluctuating floor.</p>
<p>Not with eyes, but with skin the emptiness felt. Letting light into the murk should have made a difference, but nothing has changed in the distance: infinity teases with its monotone, killing the candle with the vastness of empty existence. Step to the left, step to the right, and blackness starts within the reach of the light. How terrible the body feels without walls! Hopelessness eats the insides. Skin holds a solid object, giving way for flexible wax to adopt a ghostly fire on the top. And except for this encounter of boundaries, there is nothing to be found. The body runs, leaving an echo behind itself. Water is dripping from the above, and light disappears before it could reach the ceiling.</p>
<p>With another step candle will reel and fall into the watery floor, uttering its hiss while fire touches transparent death. Fingers are holding a figure: somewhere edgy, somewhere smoothly curved, detailed to oblivion, limbs randomly spread out. The absence of the world torments the soul. The body falls on your knees, experiencing in the chest largeness of the outside and comparative littleness of the inside. Distorted shoulders lose awareness, left hand is a rope that has no ties to the right. Only the mind keeps alive memory of the gesture of lighting a candle. Body inflates to fill up all given space and bursts into little pieces, being too shallow to recognize infinity.
Water is dripping from above. It was not the abyss but a simple absorption of rays. Seeds of light recede in the mind, pulling a red thread from the back of the skull to the front. All is gone. A withered braid made of grass is hanging on a hook on a wall. Cat in boots holds a light on a writing table. A parquet floor slumbers…</p>
<p>on the other side of the planet. </p>
