 <h2> Symplectic geometry: study of infinite staircases of ellipsoid embedding capacity functions.</h2>
 <p class="citation">Farley, C., Holm, T., Magill, N., Schroder, J., Weiler, M., Wang, Z., & Zabelina, E. (2022). Four-periodic infinite staircases for four-dimensional polydisks <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15069">(arXiv:2210.15069).</a> arXiv.

<p> Project completed under supervision of Dr. Weiler and Dr. Tara Holm (Cornell Unversity) as a part of a summer research program. </p>
<p>Symplectic four-dimensional manifold can or cannot be embedded in a four-dimensional ellipsoid of a given size (eccentricity). The ellipsoid embedding function of a given symplectic four-dimensional manifold takes as an argument the eccentricity of the ellipsoid and outputs a number by which the manifold should be scaled in order to admit an embedding of that ellipsoid. In some cases, this function "looks like" a staircase, and in more unique cases, the number of "steps" is infinite, and they accumulate towards a point. In this research project, we studied ellipsoid embedding function of a polydisk (a toric domain). The goal was to find a new infinite staircase. Using different theorems (tools) for constructing embeddings and implementing the algorithms in Wolfram Mathematica and Python, we found a polydisk for which the ellipsoid embedding function is an infinite staircase. </p>

<h2>Information science, dynamical systems, and geometry
  in the study of neural representations.</h2>
  <p>This paper introduces concepts from information science such as Shannon complexity, Kolmogorov complexity, and optimal specification method into study of neural representation. Further, I mathematically define a framework of brain as a dynamical system in which representations are presented as trajectories. Finally, I discuss geometry of the state space referring to Voronoi tessellation, the concept of path homotopies and the concept of a fundamental group of a topological space. This research will be continued in the future semesters.</p>

<h2>Defining the inside and the outside in the human experience: bodily boundaries, ownership, and awareness.</h2>

<p>In this work, I begin with outlining Jacques Derrida's deconstruction method applied to binary terms "inside/outside". Then, I use psychological evidence to investigate the notion of boundary between human body's inside and the outside. I claim that the boudary is not well-defined, and is sometimes extended and redefined. Investigating perception of this boundary is an interesting direction in psychology of interoception, offline and online representations, and assimilation.</p>

<h2>Studying phyiscs, music, and history through a photography project. </h2>

<p class="citation">Read about this project in the article in <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/08/history-music-physics-harmonize-keyboard-project">Cornell Chronicle.</a></p>
<p>Under supervision of Dr. Mike Lee (Cornell University), I photographed historical instruments from the collection of the Cornell Center for Historical Keyboards. In preparation for the photoshoot, I studied the materials, the mechanisms, and musical character of the instruments. View photos <a href="photos-pianos.html">here.</a></p>
